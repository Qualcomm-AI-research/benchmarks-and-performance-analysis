# Forecaster

This project is a work-in-progress framework for analyzing computer architecture workloads run in the GEM5 simulator, to enable some basic statistical analysis of key architectural behaviors.

The code included in this repo allows for collecting data from the simulator and formatting, such that it can be analyzed more easily using mainstream data science tools.  Some analysis scripts are provided, but still under development.

The ultimate goal for this project is to leverage deep analysis into the behavior of computer architectures and systems to aid the future design and optimization.
